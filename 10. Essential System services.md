# Maintain System Time
- Keep your computers synchronised and accurate
- Helps with scheduled jobs. e.g. Backups
- Helps caching and logging
- Helps identify when issues may occur
- Time-dependents applications require very accurate clocks

--- 
We can check the date by simply using the `date` command. But, Linux store date in a seperate way i.e. number of seconds since epoch which is the first of january 1970. This is referred to as unix time. 
```bash
date +%s #This shows the current unix time.
```

Any application that uses the date to do any of its processing will usually query the unix time and convert it to the current time zone.

- **ntpdate** 
	- This is used to query a remote time server
	- Set your system clock to it
- **ntpd** 
	- runs daemon on your computer that constantly polls the time servers 
	- Ensures your computer always has the correct time.
	- It can also be used as a lcoal time server for other computers to set their clocks 

```bash
#To install ntpdate
sudo apt-get install ntpdate

#To query pool.ntp.org
sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org #This is a constantly changing link to an ntp server around the world They constantly change it so they don't overload a single ntp server. After finding a time server it will adjust the time in the device.

#To install the ntp daemon
sudo apt-get install #This automatically runs the ntp in daemon. 

#Location of ntpd
vim /etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf #This has links to different ntp servers that will keep polling different ntp servers at regular intervals to improve precision. It can also detect the difference between clock and the reference clock. And adjust the system time accordingly.

hwclock #hwclock is a utility for accessing the hardware clock also referred to as the real-time clock or rtc the hardware clock is independent of your operating system and runs even when the machine is shut down now. The time and date can differ because we are using kali in vmware which is linked with virtual hardware. It is suggested to keep the hardware clock coordinated with universal time or utc

#To set the hwclock into local time
sudo hwclock --systohc --localtime
# --systohc sets the hardware clock from the system clock and update the timestamps in /etc/adjtime
# --localtime is used to specify the time which are --localtime and --utc
```

# Chrony and Timedatectl
- Chrony
	- Chrony is a versatile implementation of the Network Time Protocol
	- It can also use reference clocks like a GPS receiver
	- It can use manual input using a wristwatch and keyboard.
	- Designed to perform well in a wide range of conditions:
		- Intermittent network connections
		- Changing temperatures
		- Virtual machines

```bash
#To install chrony
sudo apt-get install chrony
```
It should automatically be enabled after download,
```bash
#To check chrony status
systemctl status chronyd

#To check if chrony is synchronized correctly
chronyc tracking

#To start chronyd
systemctl start chronyd

#To see sources of time
chronyc sources
```

#### Timedatectl
This gives local time, universal time(utc), rtc, timezone.
```bash
#We can also set time manually
sudo timedatectl set-time "2022-09-22 10:55:23"

#To check all the possible time zone
timedatectl list-timezones

#To set time according to timezone
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kathmandu

#To remove the timedatectl
timedatectl set-ntp false
```

# System logging
- syslog
	- Message logging standard
	- Separates
		- Message generator
		- Message storage
		- Message analyser
	- Each message has a facility code indicating
		- software type 
		- Severity level
	- Used for
		- System management
		- Security auditing
		- General information
		- Analysis
		- Debuggind messages

Syslogd was the syslog system that was widely used by various distributions of linux and unix since then.

```bash
#To check which syslog we are running
ps aux | grep syslog
```

There are different types of syslog files. Syslogs files has split configuration file which helps to keep it managed and edit.

```bash
#Location of syslog file
cd /etc/rsyslog.d/

#To check changes in the syslog
vim /var/log/syslog

```

Logrotate is a utility which helps to deal with logs easier as it rotates them, compresses them, compresses them, removes them, see email logs. Rotating a log means when it gets full logs will compress and rename it to (for e.g. sys1, sys2). This will keep rotating and the numbers will be incremented until you hit a limit of whatever is set in log rotate. When the log is too old it will `deleted.` There are always systembackup log at each stage so that we can recover it from a certain point of time.

```bash
#We can check the log rotate file to see when the logs will be rotated.
vim /etc/logrotate.conf
```

**journalctl** is used to query and display messages from the systemd journal.
```bash
#If we run it with no arguments we can see the full journal
journalctl #It basically is all the important logging messages from each application that systemd is managing

#To see all the messages from the last boot.
journalctl -b  

#To see all the messages from previous last boot. 
journalctl -b -1 #hyphen 1 means from 2 boots ago and if you boot frequently you can use hyphen 2 or 3

#To see logs accordings to days
journalctl --since "2 days ago"

#To see journal regarding a certain application
journalctl -u cron.service

#Location of config file
vim /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```
#### To log straight to console
> ctrl + alt + f1
> 	This will log console 1. This range from f1 to f6.
> To **exit** we can simply 
> ctrl + alt + f7 


### To Enable one of the console permanently
1. We will go to /etc/rsyslog.d
2. Create a .conf file with sudo privileges
	`sudo vim 60-console.conf`
```bash
#inside 60-console.conf
*.* /dev/tty10 #This means all facilities and all severities
```
3. Now, we have to give /dev/tty10. so tty10 will appear when we press ctrl + alt + f10
	`sudo chown syslog /dev/tty10`
4. Restart syslog 
	`sudo service rsyslog restart`

# journald and systemd-cat
### Terms to remember
- rsyslog is the system logging implementation on your system
	- ,It implements a protocol that all the applications installed on your system can use to log information warnings and errors to the system.
- It can be configured to receive logs from systemd-journald
- You can manually send logs to systemd-journal with systemd-cat

```bash
#First we will send hello into systemd-ctl
echo hello | systemd-cat

#We can check the log via journalctl
journalctl -f

#This should also have been sent to syslog 
tail /var/log/syslog
```

### Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) basics
This refers to running your own email server in which you can send email to other users on your system as well as receive and send email via the internet. There are lots of mta's. Some of the popular are listed below:
- **Send mail** was one of the original mta's available
- **Postfix**
- **qmail**
- **exim**
These include their own implementation of send mail which is mostly backwards compatible and will emulate how it worked in addition to adding extra features

### Aliases
Aliases are part of a mail system where you can define lists or group of users or simply another name for a single user. 
For example there is a alias called `ceo@domain.com` and if you send an email to that it'll be an alias which is automatically forwarded o `ryan@domain.com`
Another example:
There is an alias called `staff@domain.com` and it will automatically send the mail to all the staffs.
![10.Aliases.png](Assets/10.Aliases.png)

```bash
#To install postfix & mutt
sudo apt-get install postfix mutt #mutt is just an email program which is easy to use and it will let us send and receive emails

#It will let us choose which server to choose. 
#Open mutt and send an email to root
mutt #It says that there is no mail folder exist.

#We can also create but we will not make rightnow. We can see that we can send a new email by typing m.
m
To: root
Subject: Hi #It will open nano editor.
K cha tani

#Save and send the email.
```
![10.Sending a mail.png](Assets/10.Sending%20a%20mail.png)

#### To set a new alias
>vim etc/aliases

```bash
postmaster: root
    |         |
    |         |__ users
    |____________ alias
```
We can create new alias as hero and include users root and kali.

![10.Giving alias.png](Assets/10.Giving%20alias.png)

Now, if we send an email to hero, then it will be sent to kali and root.

`$ will refresh the email`

- (dot).forward is a file that lives in the home directory. 
- It is used to forward all the emails somewhere else. 
- This can be useful if an employee is going on leave or has left the company.
- We can edit this file in home directory and it will send all of their emails to their replacement or to their boss.
- It's format is a comma separated list of who wants to get the email.
- It will redirect and the user is unable to see the mail.

```bash
#To see all the mail sent through the system
vim /var/log/mail.log

```

## Manage printers and printing
- CUPS
	- Common UNIX Printing System
	- This is the most common way to install configure and use printers in linux
	- The new standard
	- Manages print jobs
	- Manages print queues
	- Provides networking printing
	- Supports a very large range of printers
	- Provides web-based configuration and administrator tools

```bash
#To install CUPS
sudo apt-get install cups cups-bsd #cups-bsd provides some legacy programs that the lp system used to provide and it has some inline commands that we can use.

#Location of cupsd.conf
sudo vim /etc/cups/cupsd.conf

#To restart the cups server
sudo service cups restart
```
