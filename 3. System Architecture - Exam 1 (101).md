# Boot the system
- BIOS: **B**asic **I**nput **O**utput **S**ystem
- It is a firmware which performs hardware initialization during the boot process of the computer. You can enter bios by pressing deleting or f8 shortly after you turn it on. ^1e81ad
- bios is not accessable in virtual enviornment as it is not necessary. 

## M.I.T
- MIT: **M**otherboard **I**ntelligent **T**weaker
- Modify a lot of things in relation to overclocking and pushing more power out of computer that might not be the default such as frequency memory and voltage setting of hardware ^ba5246

## System
- Time and date

## BIOS
- Boot Option Priorities which lets us choose which OS to run and we can also keep them in order.
	UEFI: **U**nified **E**xtensible **F**irmware **I**ntelligence

| Legacy bios boot         | UEFI             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| BIOS                     |                  |
| MBR (Master Boot Record) | UEFI             |
| Boot Loader              | EFI Boot Loader  |
| Kernel                   | Kernel           |
| Operating system         | Operating system |

### Peripherals
- Configure hardware such as enabling USB support

### Chipset
- Modify the onboard chipsets, audio controllers, enable wake on lan 
- Further SATA settings which lets you o enable hot plug and ESATA on a port by port basis.

### Power
- We can configure the pc to power on by using the keyboard and mouse.

### Save & Exit
- Save and exit

## Running Ubuntu
- while the ubuntu boot is loading we can enter the command line  we can see most of the lines are for initializing grub for the linux boot process and if we move down tehre is the two most important lines which are 
	1. linux: specify which kernel to use to boot the system
	2. initrd: specify the initial ram disk which is a temporary root file system which is loaded into memory to assist in the boot up process

	- initrfs: init ram file system which provide the tools and drivers required to mount or read complex device driver.

### kernel
- It is the lowest level of replaceable software that is the interface to your hardware from your computer. 
- It is known as the brain of the computer.
- It has tons of loadable modules that allow kernel to use lots of different types of hardware without ever needing to reboot kernel modules
- kernel modules add functionality to the base kernel for things like devices file system and system calls 
- you afe free to customize the kernel for your computer as you see fit.

- Once the kernel has attached the root file system it executes a program called init. 
- init is always the first process run by a linux system so it is given the pid(process identifier) of one 

> print process list "ps aux | head"

There are different types of init program
1. **sysvinit** which was based on system v. It was the first commercial unix operating system. 
2. **systemd** are being used currently in this video, it was designed to be clean and efficient to simplify the boot process with a low memory footprint. It adds a whole bunch of functionality that sysvinit never had such as **api** and **ability to perform concurrent** and **parallel processing** at boot time.
3. **upstart** was developed by ubuntu developers.

- From a normal user point of view nothing should change between using any of the init systems they're merely a way to start the system and all of its supporting processes and to keep them running so once the unit system works the system is now booted.
> command to display the kernel message:
> "dmesg"

- The number at the beginning is the seconds

> This command will change the second to actual date
> dmesg -T

# Determine and Configuere Hardware Settings

## Components that make up a linux system
- udev
	- Device manager
	- Low level access to the linux device tree
	- Handles user space events
		- eg. Loading firmware
	- Provided by temporary filesystem (tmpfs)
	- Mounted to /dev on startup
- dbus
	- Inter-process communication mechanism
	- Framework that allows processes to talk to each other
	- Secure
	- Reliable
	- provides high-level object oriented programming interface

> cd /dev
> ls

The output is the file system access to a bunch of other devices attached to our system. 

>To check udev
>/etc/udev

**rules.d** allows you to wirte custom rules for udev 

- sysfs
	- Virtual filesystem
	- Presents information about various kernel subsystems
		- Hardware Devices 
		- Drivers
	- Mounted to /sys

>To see this system
>cd /sys
>ls

- procfs
	- Similar to sysfs
	- Presents information about proceses
	- Presents information about system information
	- Mounted to /proc
		- Can be used to interface with the kernel
		- Change parameters on the fly

>To see this system
>cd /proc
>ls

> **To view active modules** 
> lsmod
> lsmod | less

> **Enable a mod ourself**
> modprobe

>**Remove a module**
>rmmod

>**see how a hardware is configured**
>lspci
>lspci -vvv

# Run levels, boot targets and how to shutdown and reboot a system
## Run levels
- It is a number usually between 0 and 6 although up to 9 maybe used which determines which scripts or programs are run when the command to initailize the run level is run.
- This could be automatically by the init program during system boot
	- 0 - Halt or shut down system
	- 1 - Single user mode
	- 2 - Multi-user mode without networking
	- 3 - Normal boot
	- 4 - Unused/customizable
	- 5 - Run level 3 + GUI display manager
	- 6 - Reboot
- inittab
	- inittab
		- /etc/inittab

> To see script during run level
> /etc
> rc0.d to rcx.d
> if we go to rc0.d and list the files 
> we can see that most of the files start with K which means kill.

- Systemd run levels
	- Also has scripts
	- System scripts
		- /etc/systemd/system
	- Pacakge scripts
		- /usr/lib/systemd/system
	- /etc/systemd/system take precedence over /usr/lib/systemd/system
	- Uses **targets**

- Targets
	- It serve similar purpose as run levels but act a little differently.
	- Each target is named instead of numbered 
	- intended to serve a specific purpose

- systemd script example
![[3.systemd-script-example.png]]


- sysvinit script sample
![[3.sysvinit-script-sample.png]]

- sysvinit script are unreadable and difficult ot manage. So, this is one of the reasons the majority of linux distributions have moved to systemd

> **To change run level**
> init telinit x 
> we can also write 
> init x

## Shutdown
### Simple Shutdown
> shutdown -r

### To cancel shutdown
> shutdown -c

### To reboot now
> shutdown -r now

## Wall 
Wall writes to the wall or to the shell of everyone currently logged in.
> sudo wall (message)

# systemctl
This command will drive or control systemd. Its how we will start stop and restart applications. 

### To see system systemd is running
>systemctl

### To check status
> sudo systemctl (system-name)

### To stop a system
> sudo systemctl stop (system-name)

### To start a system
> sudo systemctl start (system-name)

- We can also use systemctl to change the run levels.
### To change the run level
> sudo systemctl isolate reboot.target
