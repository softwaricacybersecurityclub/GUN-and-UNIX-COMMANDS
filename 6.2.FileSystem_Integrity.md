##Inode
By definition, an inode is an index nodw which serves as a unique identifier for a specific piece of metadata on a given filesystem in linux. It maintain the integrity of file system.
###Some functions of inode in linux:
>Stores attributes of files such as 
>- Last time of change/access/modification
>- Owner/Permission data

>Store physical disk location of the data of object or file.

>Directory itself is a list of name assigned to inodes.

>If we ever become out of disk or unable to create a file or directory in because we probably run out of inodes.

There are some ways to see the inode of a file. One easiest way is mentioned below.
```
ls -il
```
Results:
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ ls -il
total 0
46673068 -rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 0 Sep 18 10:23 file.txt
46672837 -rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 0 Sep 18 10:23 simpleFile.txt
```
Here the number represent are inodes of the files.
So why do we exactly need inodes? We can use this in following way.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ ls -il
total 0
46673068 -rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 0 Sep 18 10:23 file.txt
46672837 -rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 0 Sep 18 10:23 simpleFile.txt
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ find ./ -inum 46673068 | xargs rm 
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ ls
simpleFile.txt
```
Find inodes in file system:
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ df -i
Filesystem         Inodes  IUsed    IFree IUse% Mounted on
dev                997344    625   996719    1% /dev

tmpfs              199876     59   199817    1% /run/user/1000
```
 An another command to monitor the file system in linux is ==du==. It used to show the files in a directory and also determine the amount of disk the respective directory is using.
 ```
 [ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ du -h /home/ksab/CyberSecutity_Club/Test/
4.0K	/home/ksab/CyberSecutity_Club/Test/test1
8.0K	/home/ksab/CyberSecutity_Club/Test/
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ du -h
4.0K	./test1
8.0K	.
 ```
To find out where my maximum disk space is going.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ sudo du -h --max-depth=1 / 2>/dev/null
18G	/var
27M	/root
4.0G	/opt
0	/sys
16K	/mnt
0	/proc
36M	/etc
2.6G	/home_old
16K	/lost+found
115M	/boot
12K	/srv
```
To check and repair if any problem is happen in file system we use following command.
```
sudo fsck /dev/sdb
```
##Control mounting and unmounting of filesystem
 ```
 cat /proc/self/mounts
 ```
 It is difficult to mount and unmount in file system in linux, so there is a program to automate this process i.e `fstab`.
 ```
 [ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ sudo vim /etc/fstab
 ```
 Mounting of usb drive for file sharing.
 ```
 sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/usb
 ```
 Unmount the usb drive.
 ```
 sudo umount /mnt/usb
```
##UUID in file system
It is a unique identifier attached for each of your file systems. It keeps the mounted point in exact default location even the location mount point has been changed. 
`lsblk` is another way of listing the block devices on the system and also shows the partition as well.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ lsblk
NAME     MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINTS
sda        8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk  
└─sda1     8:1    0 931.5G  0 part  
  └─home 254:0    0 931.5G  0 crypt /home
sdb        8:16   0 119.2G  0 disk  
├─sdb1     8:17   0   600M  0 part  /boot/efi
├─sdb2     8:18   0     4G  0 part  [SWAP]
└─sdb3     8:19   0 114.7G  0 part  /
sr0       11:0    1  1024M  0 rom   
```
The systemd is also able to mount files in filesystem of linux.
```
cd /lib/systemd/system
ls *.mount
```

## Manging the file permission in linux
In linux system terminal, when we type `ls -la` we can see some sort of permission given to the respective files.

```
ksab@ArchiKsab My_repo]$ ls -la
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 5 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 16 14:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 18 10:23 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 1440 Sep 13 14:03 day1_git.txt
drwxr-xr-x 8 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 19 09:37 .git
drwxr-xr-x 3 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 13 15:03 git-branch-testing
-rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab    9 Sep 13 13:18 .gitignore
drwxr-xr-x 4 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 18 11:10 naam
```

Here, the line `drwxr-xr-x` define the permissions.

```
   d rwx  r-x  r-x
   - ---  ---    ---
      |    |     |__ others
    user  group      
```
The file or directory always has seperated by permission of users, groups and others. Going further the 'rwx` it is another type of permission i.e. read, write and execute of file.
```
r ---> read
w ---> write
x ---> execute
```

These permission can also be assigned thgrough the numbers. We use the binary number system inorder to represents each group of permission.

```
        rwx r-x r-x
        421 401 401
         7   5   5 
```
So we can represent the permission like `755` which denotes the read, write and execute permission according to user, group and others.

So if you want to change permission of a file you can use the command below.

```   
chmod 755 filename
```

### Special Permission in linux file system:
--------------------------------------------
#### setuid, setgid and sticky bit
   
`Setuid` is a bit set for an excutalble permission of file for the user who created the file rather to be executable for the user who are access file other than creators. The same kind of permission is for the `setgid` which is for the group.

Lets just check a `setuid` permission by the demostration below.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab pacman]$  ls -la /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 51464 Jan 27  2022 /usr/bin/passwd
```
Here, we can notice at the executable permission, it is `s` rather being `x`. That means the suid has been set for the file.

Similarly at the `setgid` permission `s` can be seen at the group part of permission instead of being `x`. Let's just have a look it too.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab pacman]$ ll /usr/bin/write
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root tty 18440 Mar 28 18:19 /usr/bin/write*
```

The `sticky bit` is little different than these two permissions. 
It is denoted by `T` in permission. When a sticky bit is set on a directory, the file owner, diirectory owner and root user only can delete or change the file state.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab test]$ mkdir dir1
[ksab@ArchiKsab test]$ chmod +t dir1/
[ksab@ArchiKsab test]$ ll
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 12:27 ./
drwxr-xr-x 6 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 12:07 ../
drwxr-xr-t 2 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 12:27 dir1/
```

```
chmod +t filename
chmod -t filename
```

Number representation for the setuid, setgid and sticky bit.
>Setuid     --> 4
>Setgid     --> 2
>sticky bit -->1

Similarly you can also change the user and group ownership and permission of a file too.
```
chown user:group filename
chgrp username filename
chwon username filename
chown -R username *
```
So there is command `umask` which shows and change or remove the file permissions.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab pacman]$ umask -S
u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx
```
```
ksab@ArchiKsab test]$ mkdir hello
[ksab@ArchiKsab test]$ umask 0044 hello/
[ksab@ArchiKsab test]$ cd hello/
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ ll
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:20 ./
drwxr-xr-x 4 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:19 ../
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ touch text
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ ll
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:21 ./
drwxr-xr-x 4 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:19 ../
-rw--w--w- 1 ksab ksab    0 Sep 20 13:21 text
```
So in the demostration above it is shows that the `umask` command removes the read permission of file which will be created inside the `test` directory. 

## Links in linux file system
As mentioned eariler, files in linux are generally represented by an inode. File in linux can removed only when all the link to an inode are removed.
We have two different types of links in linux, i.e.
- Hard link
- Soft link
A hard link is a link to another files inode which can only occur on the same filesystem. Whereas a softlink is a link to another file inode which can occurs across different filesystem [like shortcuts in windows].

```
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ ll
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:49 ./
drwxr-xr-x 4 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:19 ../
-r---w---- 1 ksab ksab    0 Sep 20 13:27 hello.txt
drwxrwxr-x 2 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:49 linkDir/
-rw--w--w- 1 ksab ksab    0 Sep 20 13:21 text
```
Here, the number representation after the permissions are links. The normal file like `hello.txt` here has only one link but the directory usually have 2 links or more like `linkdir` here.
### Creating links in linux
So `ln` command is used in linux to create links. Here a simple demostration has been given.
>Hard Link
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ echo "Hey! How are you?" >> message.txt
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ ls
linkDir  message.txt
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ ln message.txt msg.txt
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ ll
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 3 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:57 ./
drwxr-xr-x 4 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:19 ../
drwxrwxr-x 2 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:49 linkDir/
-rw-rw-r-- 2 ksab ksab   18 Sep 20 13:56 message.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 2 ksab ksab   18 Sep 20 13:56 msg.txt
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ cat msg.txt 
Hey! How are you?
```
>Soft Link
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ ln -s /bin/vim link_vim
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ ls -la
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 3 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 14:07 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:19 ..
drwxrwxr-x 2 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 20 13:49 linkDir
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ksab ksab    8 Sep 20 14:07 link_vim -> /bin/vim
[ksab@ArchiKsab hello]$ ./link_vim file.txt
```
