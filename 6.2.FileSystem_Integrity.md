##Inode
By definition, an inode is an index nodw which serves as a unique identifier for a specific piece of metadata on a given filesystem in linux. It maintain the integrity of file system.
###Some functions of inode in linux:
>Stores attributes of files such as 
>- Last time of change/access/modification
>- Owner/Permission data

>Store physical disk location of the data of object or file.

>Directory itself is a list of name assigned to inodes.

>If we ever become out of disk or unable to create a file or directory in because we probably run out of inodes.

There are some ways to see the inode of a file. One easiest way is mentioned below.
```
ls -il
```
Results:
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ ls -il
total 0
46673068 -rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 0 Sep 18 10:23 file.txt
46672837 -rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 0 Sep 18 10:23 simpleFile.txt
```
Here the number represent are inodes of the files.
So why do we exactly need inodes? We can use this in following way.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ ls -il
total 0
46673068 -rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 0 Sep 18 10:23 file.txt
46672837 -rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 0 Sep 18 10:23 simpleFile.txt
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ find ./ -inum 46673068 | xargs rm 
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ ls
simpleFile.txt
```
Find inodes in file system:
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ df -i
Filesystem         Inodes  IUsed    IFree IUse% Mounted on
dev                997344    625   996719    1% /dev
run                999381    942   998439    1% /run

/dev/sdb1               0      0        0     - /boot/efi
/dev/mapper/home 61046784 540833 60505951    1% /home
tmpfs              199876     59   199817    1% /run/user/1000
```
 An another command to monitor the file system in linux is ==du==. It used to show the files in a directory and also determine the amount of disk the respective directory is using.
 ```
 [ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ du -h /home/ksab/CyberSecutity_Club/Test/
4.0K	/home/ksab/CyberSecutity_Club/Test/test1
8.0K	/home/ksab/CyberSecutity_Club/Test/
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ du -h
4.0K	./test1
8.0K	.
 ```
To find out where my maximum disk space is going.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ sudo du -h --max-depth=1 / 2>/dev/null
18G	/var
27M	/root
4.0G	/opt
0	/sys
16K	/mnt
0	/proc
36M	/etc
2.6G	/home_old
16K	/lost+found
115M	/boot
12K	/srv
```
To check and repair if any problem is happen in file system we use following command.
```
sudo fsck /dev/sdb
```
##Control mounting and unmounting of filesystem
 ```
 cat /proc/self/mounts
 ```
 It is difficult to mount and unmount in file system in linux, so there is a program to automate this process i.e `fstab`.
 ```
 [ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ sudo vim /etc/fstab
 ```
 Mounting of usb drive for file sharing.
 ```
 sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/usb
 ```
 Unmount the usb drive.
 ```
 sudo umount /mnt/usb
```
##UUID in file system
It is a unique identifier attached for each of your file systems. It keeps the mounted point in exact default location even the location mount point has been changed. 
`lsblk` is another way of listing the block devices on the system and also shows the partition as well.
```
[ksab@ArchiKsab Test]$ lsblk
NAME     MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINTS
sda        8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk  
└─sda1     8:1    0 931.5G  0 part  
  └─home 254:0    0 931.5G  0 crypt /home
sdb        8:16   0 119.2G  0 disk  
├─sdb1     8:17   0   600M  0 part  /boot/efi
├─sdb2     8:18   0     4G  0 part  [SWAP]
└─sdb3     8:19   0 114.7G  0 part  /
sr0       11:0    1  1024M  0 rom   
```
The systemd is also able to mount files in filesystem of linux.
```
cd /lib/systemd/system
ls *.mount
```

## Manging the file permission in linux
In linux system terminal, when we type `ls -la` we can see some sort of permission given to the respective files.

```
ksab@ArchiKsab My_repo]$ ls -la
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 5 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 16 14:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 18 10:23 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab 1440 Sep 13 14:03 day1_git.txt
drwxr-xr-x 8 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 19 09:37 .git
drwxr-xr-x 3 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 13 15:03 git-branch-testing
-rw-r--r-- 1 ksab ksab    9 Sep 13 13:18 .gitignore
drwxr-xr-x 4 ksab ksab 4096 Sep 18 11:10 naam
```

Here, the line `drwxr-xr-x` define the permissions.

```
   d rwx  r-x  r-x
   - ---  ---  ---
      |    |     |__ others
    user  group      
```
The file or directory always has seperated by permission of users, groups and others. Going further the 'rwx` it is another type of permission i.e. read, write and execute of file.
```
r ---> read
w ---> write
x ---> execute
```

These permission can also be assigned thgrough the numbers. We use the binary number system inorder to represents each group of permission.

```
        rwx r-x r-x
        421 401 401
         7   5   5 
```
So we can represent the permission like `755` which denotes the read, write and execute permission according to user, group and others.

So if you want to change permission of a file you can use the command below.

```
chmod 755 filename
```

### Special Permission in linux file system:
--------------------------------------------
#### setuid, setgid and sticky bit
