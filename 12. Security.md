# Perform Security Administration Tasks
We can audit a system to find a files with suid and the sgid bit set with find command.
```bash
sudo find / -perm /u=s,g=s #finds a file of user and group with suid or sgid bit set.
passwd #we can change passwed of own with this command.
```

** Nmap**
Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a [free and open source](https://nmap.org/npsl/) utility for network discovery and security auditing.
It is use to see open ports and services running. Some of the uses example are 
```bash
namp localhost # will scan own machine for wellknown open port 
nmap -sP ip #perform a ping scan only
nmap -0 ip # operating system detection
nmap -sV ip # service version detection
nmap -sV -p- -A ip #most used way to scan

```
** Netstat**
It will show us which port is listning for connections.
```bash
netstat -at #show all active internet connection
```

** lsof **
It is also used to lost open file.

```bash
sudo lsof | grep LISTEN #shows all the open port and which processors are keeping the connection
```

To see which user is loged in we can use who, w.
```bash
who # show the loged in user
w # same but with some more information
last | tail #shows the history of everyone loged in to the system
sudo visudo #lets us edit sudoer file
id # show uid and group
su #used to change user
```

# Setup Host Security
```bash
sudo touch /etc/nologin # It only gives login access to root
```

** Xinetd **
It is a utility that listens for incoming requests over a network and launches the approprite program to handle that request.
To install 
```bash 
sudo apt install xinetd
```

The configuration file is at /etc/xinetd.d/.

## tcpd
* Monitors incoming requests
* Program triggered by xinetd
* xinetd starts tcpd instead of desired server
* tcpd logs the request and additional checks
* tcpd runs the appropriate program
* logs sent to syslog
* has access control that also uses /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny


## Systemd sockets
A socket is a way for two different processes to share data locally or over a network.
Socket file is found in /lib/systemd/system

# Secure data with Encryption
Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic protocol and interface for executing network services, shell services and secure network communication with a remote computer. Secure Shell enables two remotely connected users to perform network communication and other services on top of an unsecured network. It was initially a Unix-based command but is now supported on Windows-based systems as well.
```bash
ssh hostname@ip #to connect to specific ip
```

## ssh keys
* Used for passwordless authentication
* Generate two keys (keypair):
	* Private key
		* your key
		* Don't share it
		* keep it safe
	* Public key
		* copy to server you wish to login to

To create a public and private key we use->
```bash
ssh-keygen # You can add a passphrase if need
```

To use ssh generated key of ssh login we should copy the id_rsa.pub to the needed computer in .ssh/authorized_key.
And now you can just login with ssh key and if passphrese is used you have to type it.

### New encryption key types 
* ECDSA - OpenSSH 5.7
* ED25519 - OpenSSH 6.5
